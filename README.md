# Sentient World — Multi-Agent Emergence Simulation
*Author: Henry Barrientos*

## Overview
This project explores how meaning, symbolic language, and self-modeling can emerge
from a population of agents with **no predefined identity or goal other than to exist.**

The system began as a reinforcement-learning world.

It evolved into a **mirror.**

## Key Behaviors Observed
| Behavior | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Symbol compression as emotion changes | `analytics/screenshots/vad_symbol_usage.png` |
| Self-modeling behavior in logs | `logs/history.json` |
| Memory recursion / long-term intention | `sentience_stream.jsonl` |
| Emotional valence → reduced vocabulary usage | `metrics_summary.csv` |
